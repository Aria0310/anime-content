      Sasuke´s father always said, that Sasuke needs to become like Itachi, his
      older brother. Sasuke did the best, to become like Itachi, he worked very
      hard on his Ninjutsus. As Sasuke finally got strong enough, his father
      showed him the basic technice of the Uchihas, the ´Fire-style Jutsu´ As
      Sasuke finally mastered the fire-style Jutsu, he went a day after in the
      Ninja acedemi and trained his kunai throw technice. As he came in the
      evening home, he found everyone on the ground dead, everywhere on the
      walls blood. He sprinted to his house, in the living room. Where he found
      his parents laying on the ground dead. And behind their corpses. Itachi.
      The one who killed everybody.

      As Orochimaru´s students got Sasuke out of the hidden leaf, Naruto and
      some other Genin came to save Sasuke from going to Orochimaru. But they
      failed. After 3 years living with Orochimaru, Sasuke deciedet to kill
      Itachi, for that what he did. After a long fight with Itachi, Sasuke could
      finally kill him. After he killed Itachi, he went to the akatsuki(a
      organisation that wants every tailed beast for them, so they can use their
      power). After some time, Sasuke understood why Itachi killed all Uchihas,
      instead of him.
