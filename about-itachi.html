    <h2 class="headline">Itachi´s Childhood</h2>
    <p>
      As Itachi was young, he was very strong and could end a mission of an anbu
      unit (an secret unit of ninjas by the hidden Leaf). At the age of 13 he
      became an anbu follower and endet many missions sucsessfully. His best
      friend Shisui(also an Uchiha), was going between an anbu unit, they had a
      mission. Shisui arguered with them that they cant govern in such a way.
      But li´l does he know, that the anbu unit is one of danzo´s follower.
      Danzo was a realy good friend with the Hockage of the 3rd generation, but
      he hated the Uchiha like the 2nd Hockage did. So when a uchiha died, he
      took the eyes of the corpse and put it into his arm, so he could use the
      abillity of the Sharingan (A special Dojutsu, that omly uchiahs have).
      Shisui wanted to stop Danzo, stealing the eyes of his caln. So fought with
      the anbu unit. Shisui was very inferior. Itachi cam to help him. Shisui
      was nealy dead, as he gave his eyes to Itachi, so Danzo could´nt get them.

      Itachi was very upset because Shisui´s dead. So he dicedet to kill the
      Uchiha, so he dont have to go through more pain. But he wasnt alone, he
      had help, by Obito Uchiha, the one who wanted to be hockage but died for a
      friend.
